This is my version of etherminer for windows.
Make sure to edit the start.bat file.
The program usually crashes so run the loop file in order to keep the start.bat file running.
Make sure to create an exception in your antivirus for the program.
The GPU.txt file has settings if your gpu is slower!

Any problems just leave a comment!
